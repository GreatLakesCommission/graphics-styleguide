# Urban Institute Dataviz Styleguide

Use this data visualization style guide to create a uniform look and feel to all of Urban Instituteâ€™s charts and graphs. This site contains guidelines that are in line with data visualization best practices and proven design principles. It also eliminates the burden of design and color decisions when creating charts.
